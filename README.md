# Typescript Starter

This is just a template for how I start typescript projects

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| npm run prod | Build the project for production, all code must be manually fixed before running this command |
| npm run dev | Watches for file changes, lints and builds the project |
| rpm run dev:lint | Lints the project and fixes issues on file changes |

I start with dev:lint and then switch to dev when I need to preview what the code does.

I'm not sure if this is the best way to do this, but it works for me. I'm open to suggestions.
